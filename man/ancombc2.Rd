\arguments{
\item{data}{the input data. The \code{data} parameter should be either a
\code{phyloseq} or a \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object, which
consists of a feature table (microbial count table), a sample metadata table,
a taxonomy table (optional), and a phylogenetic tree (optional).
Ensure that the row names of the metadata table match the sample names in the
feature table, and the row names of the taxonomy table match the taxon
(feature) names in the feature table. For detailed information, refer to
\code{?phyloseq::phyloseq} or
\code{?TreeSummarizedExperiment::TreeSummarizedExperiment}.
It is recommended to use low taxonomic levels, such as OTU or species level,
as the estimation of sampling fractions requires a large number of taxa.}

\item{assay_name}{character. Name of the count table in the data object
(only applicable if data object is a \code{(Tree)SummarizedExperiment}).
Default is "counts".
See \code{?SummarizedExperiment::assay} for more details.}

\item{tax_level}{character. The taxonomic level of interest. The input data
can be analyzed at any taxonomic level without prior agglomeration.
Note that \code{tax_level} must be a value from \code{taxonomyRanks}, which
includes "Kingdom", "Phylum" "Class", "Order", "Family" "Genus" or "Species".
See \code{?mia::taxonomyRanks} for more details.
Default is NULL, i.e., do not perform agglomeration, and the
ANCOM-BC2 anlysis will be performed at the lowest taxonomic level of the
input \code{data}.}

\item{fix_formula}{the character string expresses how the microbial absolute
abundances for each taxon depend on the fixed effects in metadata. When
specifying the \code{fix_formula}, make sure to include the \code{group}
variable in the formula if it is not NULL.}

\item{rand_formula}{the character string expresses how the microbial absolute
abundances for each taxon depend on the random effects in metadata. ANCOM-BC2
follows the \code{lmerTest} package in formulating the random effects. See
\code{?lmerTest::lmer} for more details. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{p_adj_method}{character. method to adjust p-values. Default is "holm".
Options include "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY",
"fdr", "none". See \code{?stats::p.adjust} for more details.}

\item{prv_cut}{a numerical fraction between 0 and 1. Taxa with prevalences
(the proportion of samples in which the taxon is present)
less than \code{prv_cut} will be excluded in the analysis. For example,
if there are 100 samples, and a taxon has nonzero counts present in less than
100*prv_cut samples, it will not be considered in the analysis.
Default is 0.10.}

\item{lib_cut}{a numerical threshold for filtering samples based on library
sizes. Samples with library sizes less than \code{lib_cut} will be
excluded in the analysis. Default is 0, i.e. do not discard any sample.}

\item{s0_perc}{a numerical fraction between 0 and 1. Inspired by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.091062498}{Significance
Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)} methodology, a small positive constant is
added to the denominator of ANCOM-BC2 test statistic corresponding to
each taxon to avoid the significance due to extremely small standard errors,
especially for rare taxa. This small positive constant is chosen as
\code{s0_perc}-th percentile of standard error values for each fixed effect.
Default is 0.05 (5th percentile).}

\item{group}{character. the name of the group variable in metadata.
The \code{group} parameter should be a character string representing the name
of the group variable in the metadata. The \code{group} variable should be
discrete, meaning it consists of categorical values. Specifying the
\code{group} variable is required if you are interested in detecting
structural zeros and performing performing multi-group comparisons (global
test, pairwise directional test, Dunnett's type of test, and trend test).
However, if these analyses are not of interest to you, you can leave the
\code{group} parameter as NULL. If the \code{group} variable of interest
contains only two categories, you can also leave the \code{group} parameter
as NULL. Default is NULL.}

\item{struc_zero}{logical. Whether to detect structural zeros based on
\code{group}. Default is FALSE. See \code{Details} for
a more comprehensive discussion on structural zeros.}

\item{neg_lb}{logical. Whether to classify a taxon as a structural zero using
its asymptotic lower bound. Default is FALSE.}

\item{alpha}{numeric. Level of significance. Default is 0.05.}

\item{n_cl}{numeric. The number of nodes to be forked. For details, see
\code{?parallel::makeCluster}. Default is 1 (no parallel computing).}

\item{verbose}{logical. Whether to generate verbose output during the
ANCOM-BC2 fitting process. Default is FALSE.}

\item{global}{logical. Whether to perform the global test. Default is FALSE.}

\item{pairwise}{logical. Whether to perform the pairwise directional test.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{dunnet}{logical. Whether to perform the Dunnett's type of test.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{trend}{logical. Whether to perform trend test. Default is FALSE.}

\item{iter_control}{a named list of control parameters for the iterative
MLE or RMEL algorithm, including 1) \code{tol}: the iteration convergence
tolerance (default is 1e-02), 2) \code{max_iter}: the maximum number of
iterations (default is 20), and 3)\code{verbose}: whether to show the verbose
output (default is FALSE).}

\item{em_control}{a named list of control parameters for the E-M algorithm,
including 1) \code{tol}: the iteration convergence tolerance
(default is 1e-05) and 2) \code{max_iter}: the maximum number of iterations
(default is 100).}

\item{lme_control}{a list of control parameters for mixed model fitting.
See \code{?lme4::lmerControl} for details.}

\item{mdfdr_control}{a named list of control parameters for mixed directional
false discover rate (mdFDR), including 1) \code{fwer_ctrl_method}: family
wise error (FWER) controlling procedure, such as "holm", "hochberg",
"bonferroni", etc (default is "holm") and 2) \code{B}: the number of
bootstrap samples (default is 100). Increase \code{B} will lead to a more
accurate p-values. See \code{Details} for a more comprehensive discussion on
mdFDR.}

\item{trend_control}{a named list of control parameters for the trend test,
including 1) \code{contrast}: the list of contrast matrices for
constructing inequalities, 2) \code{node}: the list of positions for the
nodal parameter, 3) \code{solver}: a string indicating the solver to use
(default is "ECOS"), and 4) \code{B}: the number of bootstrap samples
(default is 100). Increase \code{B} will lead to a more accurate p-values.
See \code{vignette} for the corresponding trend test examples.}

\description{
Determine taxa whose absolute abundances, per unit volume, of
the ecosystem (e.g., gut) are significantly different with changes in the
covariate of interest (e.g., group). The current version of
\code{ancombc2} function implements Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes
with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC2) in cross-sectional and repeated measurements
data. In addition to the two-group comparison, ANCOM-BC2 also supports
testing for continuous covariates and multi-group comparisons,
including the global test, pairwise directional test, Dunnett's type of
test, and trend test.

\details{
A taxon is considered to have structural zeros in some (>=1)
groups if it is completely (or nearly completely) missing in these groups.
For instance, suppose there are three groups: g1, g2, and g3.
If the counts of taxon A in g1 are 0 but nonzero in g2 and g3,
then taxon A will be considered to contain structural zeros in g1.
In this example, taxon A is declared to be differentially abundant between
g1 and g2, g1 and g3, and consequently, it is globally differentially
abundant with respect to this group variable.
Such taxa are not further analyzed using ANCOM-BC2, but the results are
summarized in the overall summary. For more details about the structural
zeros, please go to the
\href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02114}{ANCOM-II} paper.
Setting \code{neg_lb = TRUE} indicates that you are using both criteria
stated in section 3.2 of
\href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02114}{ANCOM-II}
to detect structural zeros; otherwise, the algorithm will only use the
equation 1 in section 3.2 for declaring structural zeros. Generally, it is
recommended to set \code{neg_lb = TRUE} when the sample size per group is
relatively large (e.g. > 30).

Like other differential abundance analysis methods, ANCOM-BC2 applies a log
transformation to the observed counts. However, the presence of zero counts
poses a challenge, and researchers often consider adding a pseudo-count before
the log transformation. However, it has been shown that the choice of
pseudo-count can impact the results and lead to an inflated false positive
rate (\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2897}{Costea et al. (2014)};
\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2898}{Paulson, Bravo, and Pop (2014)}).
To address this issue, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact
of different pseudo-counts on zero counts for each taxon. This analysis
involves adding a series of pseudo-counts (ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 in
increments of 0.01) to the zero counts of each taxon. Linear regression
models are then performed on the bias-corrected log abundance table using the
different pseudo-counts. The sensitivity score for each taxon is calculated
as the proportion of times that the p-value exceeds the specified
significance level (alpha). If all p-values consistently show significance or
nonsignificance across different pseudo-counts and are consistent with the
results obtained without adding pseudo-counts to zero counts (using the
default settings), then the taxon is considered not sensitive to the
pseudo-count addition.

When performning pairwise directional (or Dunnett's type of) test, the mixed
directional false discover rate (mdFDR) should be taken into account.
The mdFDR is the combination of false discovery rate due to multiple testing,
multiple pairwise comparisons, and directional tests within each pairwise
comparison. For example, suppose we have five taxa and three experimental
groups: g1, g2, and g3. Thus, we are performing five tests corresponding to
five taxa. For each taxon, we are also conducting three pairwise comparisons
(g1 vs. g2, g2 vs. g3, and g1 vs. g3). Within each pairwise comparison,
we wish to determine if the abundance has increased or decreased or did not
change (direction of the effect size). Errors could occur in each step.
The overall false discovery rate is controlled by the mdFDR methodology we
adopted from
\href{https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01292.x}{Guo, Sarkar, and Peddada (2010)} and
\href{https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-0937-5}{Grandhi, Guo, and Peddada (2016)}.
