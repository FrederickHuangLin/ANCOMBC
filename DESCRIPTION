Title: Analysis of compositions of microbiomes with bias correction
Version: 1.0.2
Description: ANCOMBC is a package for normalizing the microbial absolute 
    abundance data due to unequal sampling fractions across samples, and 
    identifying taxa (e.g. phyla, families, genera, species, etc.) that are 
    differentially abundant with respect to the covariate of interest (e.g.
    study groups) between two or more groups of multiple samples.
